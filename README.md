# USAC-Coaching-Portal
[Video Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8C6cImKWzc)

We worked with USA Climbing to develop a tool to help their staff and coaches communicate more efficiently and effectively throughout the certification process for competition season. The current system for the administration at USAC involved bringing together information from multiple sources into an excel spreadsheet and putting it together by hand. We our app a coach and the staff can go to one place to submit and verify information.

#### TECHNOLOGIES USED
To build this full stack application we used HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Express, PostgresSQL, Node, Cloudinary, Photoshop, Apple Music, Beer. Special thanks to Margo Hayes.

#### WORKFLOW
Our group used Agile methodologies with the help of Trello, and GitHub version control with feature branch method with one master file.
